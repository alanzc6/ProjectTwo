Words In Motion by Alan Zamora

## Project Overview

Community to my means a lot of different things, a lot of DIFFERENT THINGS that can come together. Community is a place where people can come and connect. A Place where mutuals can find something in common in bond over. It's a place to build relationships, friendships etc. Community to be is not complicated, it's just a place to share, as simple as that!

## Overview

My project was created using HTML & CSS with the help of VSC and GitHub to create a one of a kind interactive text based website. This website will carry you with what I believe community is using different animations, colors and effects.
